                John McCarthy was born on March 3, 1952 in Jersey City, New
                Jersey. John is the oldest of six children. John's father, John
                'Jack' McCarthy, now deceased, was a World War II Navy Veteran
                who served his country in both the European and Asian theaters.
                Following World War II, John's father attended Georgetown
                University on the GI Bill. John's mother, Jane, also deceased,
                was the oldest of nine children. John's commitment to public
                service was inspired by the example of his parents.
            </p>

            <p>
                John attended both grammar and high school in the New Jersey
                suburbs outside of Philadelphia. John graduated from Camden
                Catholic High School in Cherry Hill, New Jersey in 1970, where
                he served as student government president his senior year. John
                attended Catholic University of America on a baseball
                scholarship between 1970 and 1974. Following his graduation from
                Catholic University, John taught at Good Counsel High School in
                Wheaton, Maryland and, while teaching, John attended law school
                in the evenings at the University of Baltimore. John graduated
                in 1979. John was admitted to the Maryland Bar in 1979 and began
                his legal career in private practice. John joined the State's
                Attorney's Office for Prince George's County in 1980 and
                eighteen months later became a Public Defender in Montgomery
                County. John joined the State's Attorney's Office for Montgomery
                County in 1982.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before ascending to the position of State's Attorney in 2006,
                John served as Deputy State's Attorney in Montgomery County for
                ten years. Prior to that, John had headed every major trial
                division in the office. John is the father of four children, and
                grandfather to five.

            <h2>Promises Made & Kept</h2>
            <h3>
                When I ran for State's Attorney in 2006, I promised that I would
                use my years in office to combat criminal gangs, internet
                predators, domestic violence, and truancy. That is exactly what
                I have done!
            </h3>

            <h3>Gangs</h3>
            <p style="margin-top: 0">
                I promised that tackling gangs would be my top priority as
                State's Attorney and I have renewed my efforts in 2017.
                Immediately upon taking Office I launched the Anti-Gang
                Initiative. In the summer of 2007, I created the first full-time
                Gang Prosecution Unit in Maryland. Under the Anti-Gang
                Initiative, all crimes committed by known gang members are
                prosecuted by the Gang Prosecution Unit. Since its inception,
                the Gang Prosecution Unit has prosecuted over 2,500 gang members
                for criminal offenses committed in Montgomery County. Gang
                prosecutors prosecute cases in the Circuit, District, and
                Juvenile courts.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to prosecuting gang members who commit criminal
                offenses, the State's Attorney's Office also reaches out to the
                community to help educate young people and parents about the
                warning signs and dangers of gang activity. As part of my
                progressive approach to addressing the gang issue in our
                community, the State's Attorney's Office has participated in and
                helped organize events aimed to provide young people with safe
                and fun alternative to gang involvement.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2017, I petitioned the county for additional resources to add
                to the effectiveness of the Anti-Gang Initiative. In response to
                the recent increase in gang violence, I formed the Gang Work
                Group in April, 2017, to develop recommendations to reduce the
                violence. The Gang Work Group focuses on the strategic use of a
                new Maryland law, effective October 1, 2017, Article 9-804,
                Participation in criminal gangs prohibited. The Gang Work Group
                utilizes the new law in its effort to remove gang leadership.
            </p>

            <h3 style="margin-top: 25px">Domestic Violence</h3>
            <p>
                I promised that we would continue the fight against domestic
                violence in our community. In 2009, the State's Attorney's
                Office joined with a number of private and public partners to
                open the Montgomery County Family Justice Center (FJC). The FJC
                is a joint partnership of the Montgomery County State's
                Attorney's Office, the Sheriff's Office, the Montgomery County
                Police, the Department of Health and Human Services, the House
                of Ruth, Catholic Charities, the Interfaith Community Against
                Domestic Violence, and others.
            </p>
            <p>
                The FJC is a one-stop destination for victims of domestic
                violence. Victims can go to the FJC to obtain peace orders,
                answer immigration questions, get counseling services, and get
                emergency services as needed. Specially trained Domestic
                Violence prosecutors then work with police and victims to hold
                abusers responsible for their crimes and break the cycle of
                abuse. In 2010, Montgomery County celebrated a full year without
                a domestic violence homicide. We are saving lives!
            </p>

            <h3 style="margin-top: 25px">Internet Safety</h3>
            <p>
                I promised that I would use the power of my office to protect
                children from Internet predators. Since taking office, I have
                forged an unprecedented partnership with the Montgomery County
                Public Schools and the Montgomery County Police Department to
                teach young people how to avoid being victims of Internet
                predators. I and members of my office have gone to dozens of
                public and private schools, presenting age appropriate programs
                to young people on how to avoid dangerous activities online,
                such as posting personal information. I have also spoken at PTA
                meetings and Parent Academies, trying to provide parents with
                the tools they need to keep their children safe. Additionally, I
                worked with the Public Schools and the Police to add Internet
                safety to the school curriculum for the first time. This
                collaborative effort ensures that students receive the
                information they need to avoid those who would use technology to
                prey upon them.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, I assigned a specially trained prosecutor to prosecute
                Internet predators. By educating parents and students, and
                prosecuting predators, I have worked to ensure that our children
                are safe from criminals who would use technology to target our
                most vulnerable citizens.
            </p>

            <h3 style="margin-top: 25px">Truancy</h3>
            <p>
                I promised that I would work to reduce truancy in schools. We
                are fortunate to have some of the best schools in the country
                right here in Montgomery County, and it is imperative that we
                ensure that students benefit from the world-class education our
                schools provide. The data clearly shows that students who are
                habitually truant from school are at a higher risk of engaging
                in dangerous and/or illegal activities. The State's Attorney's
                Office works with the Montgomery County Public Schools and other
                county organizations as part of the Truancy Review Board. The
                Truancy Review Board meets regarding instances where students
                are habitually truant, and works with parents and students to
                make sure that students attend school. The goal of these efforts
                is not to put people in jail, but to ensure that students attend
                school. If students still do not attend school even after these
                efforts, the State's Attorney's Office can file charges against
                the student's guardian.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, the State's Attorney's Office has developed
                Truancy Court in conjunction with Montgomery County Public
                Schools. Truancy Court is a program that is held in selected
                middle schools in Montgomery County. The program initially
                involved only two schools, but has since expanded to include
                over twenty. I initially discovered that federal funding was
                available to set up the program through the University of
                Baltimore Law School, and personally worked with administrators
                there and in the Public Schools to ensure that Montgomery County
                received funding to establish a pilot program at schools that
                are particularly impacted by truancy.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since the initial establishment of Truancy Court nine years ago,
                the program has continued to expand and now serves hundreds of
                at-risk children who have, as a result of their participation in
                the program, seen marked improvement in both their attendance
                and academic achievement.
